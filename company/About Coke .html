        On May 8, 1886, Dr. John Pemberton brought his perfected syrup to
        Jacobs' Pharmacy in downtown Atlanta where the first glass of Coca‑Cola
        was poured. From that one iconic drink, we’ve evolved into a total
        beverage company. More than 2.2 billion servings of our drinks are
        enjoyed in more than 200 countries and territories each day.

        We are constantly transforming our portfolio, from reducing added sugar
        in our drinks to bringing innovative new products to market. We seek to
        positively impact people’s lives, communities and the planet through
        water replenishment, packaging recycling, sustainable sourcing practices
        and carbon emissions reductions across our value chain. Together with
        our bottling partners, we employ more than 700,000 people, helping bring
        economic opportunity to local communities worldwide.
